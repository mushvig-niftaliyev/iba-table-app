# iba-table-app
This is the challenge code for ediitable table app

# Installation

Clone the repo to your local machine

Install dependencies both for server and ui-app

Boot up the modules separately or go to server directory and run `npm start`. This will boot up both server and client apps.

# For SERVER I used
1) Nodejs with Express for api
2) Nodemon for live updates of the server
3) Cors for cors origin policy bypassing

# For the CLIENT I used
1) React
2) TypeScript as main lang
3) Material UI for UI components (they look terrible, i know)
4) Lodash for deep object comparison
5) React-query (i have always wanted to try it and im amazed)
